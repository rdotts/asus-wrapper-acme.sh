Should be working 100% except for the revoke command, and according to Gary, that should be straightforward to add.  This is basically a fork, except git doesn't really have a handler for forking a block of text from a forum.  The only change I made was adding this comment block to explain where this came from with no history.  Hopefully this is following the spirit (if not the letter) of open source licensing.
